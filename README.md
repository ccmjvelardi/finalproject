Final Project on Crash-Test Ratings

### Purpose of This Project

- This project will investigate vehicle safety data from NHTSA in 2024. Data Science questions will be asked and plotted in determining which cars in 2011-2024 are the safest for consumers. Thereâ€™s a lot of potential clients who could use this data such as consumers, rental car companies, automobile insurance, etc. For the sake of this project, this project will aim more towards rental car companies, seeing as how important safety is to these companies.
